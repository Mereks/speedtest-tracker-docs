### Introduction

Speedtest Tracker is a self-hosted internet performance tracking application that runs speedtest checks against Ookla's Speedtest service.

#### Why might I want this?

The main use case for Speedtest Tracker is to build a history of your internet's performance so that you can be informed when you're not receiving your ISP's advertised rates.

_...also some of us just like a lot of data._

#### What about that other Speedtest Tracker?

As far as I can tell [https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/Speedtest-Tracker](https://github.com/henrywhitaker3/Speedtest-Tracker) was abandoned. This version is meant to be an actively maintained replacement with an improved UI and [feature](getting-started/features.md) set.

#### Do you have a demo?

No, but DB Tech over on YouTube has an awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feArak6WCLw) showing you how to get Speedtest Tracker up and running with Portainer and a quick demo.
